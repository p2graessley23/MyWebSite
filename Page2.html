<p> Marisha Ray is a voice actress and producer. I know her best from her roles on Critical Role. She plays Keyleth in campaign 1 and Beauregard in campaign 2. She was born in Kentucky on May 10, 1989. She married her co-star and Dungeon Master Matthew Mercer on October 21. Marisha Ray was creative director for Geek & Sundry from 2017 to 2018. She left Geek & Sundry and became the creative director for Critical Role.</p>
<p>I chose Marisha Ray as my hero because she is not afraid to be who she is. She is a great D&D player in more than one way. After Critical Role got really popular she had a lot of backlash in the comments over her portrayal of Keyleth, but she did't change her character. She continued to play her Keyleth how she wanted to play her. I think that shows confidence and I really look up to how she continues to do what she loves. Honestly, I look up to the entire Critical Role cast. They are all funny and kind. They worked really hard to get where they are.</p>
