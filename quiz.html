1. Make lists
2. set a variable counting in display question
3. Display the question that the counter wants
4. Set box value euqal to counter variable
5. Check beforehand to see if counter exceeds the length of the list, if so either stop or repeat from index 0
6. Set a variable to equal the user's answer
7. Check if input is equal to the answer by calling index number, if so return correct, else return not correct
8 If correct add to score, if not do not add
9. Alert correct or incorrect
